# Gearhead: A motorbike performance analysis tool

Project Gearhead started with the following question: "How much time will I gain in acceleration if I change my motorcycle sprockets?"

This was enough for my friend Jesus Medina Mundt - Industrial  Engineer -, to open Excel and throw some math at it. After a couple iterations he had some really cool info there and I thought we could make an app out of it, took the opportunity to also learn a new SDK in the process.

**Status:** Lots of features still need to be developed
